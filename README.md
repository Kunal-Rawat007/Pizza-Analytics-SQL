## 📋 Description

The dataset represents a fictional pizza sales business, containing tables like:

- `orders`
- `order_details`
- `pizzas`
- `pizza_types`
- `customers`

Using this data, the project answers key business questions such as:

- 🔝 What are the top-selling pizzas?
- 💰 What is the average order value?
- 🧀 Which is the most popular pizza category?
- 📅 On which day of the week do we receive the most orders?
- 📈 What does the yearly revenue trend look like?

Each question is answered using optimized SQL queries, and the [results]() are visualized and compiled in a clean PDF format.
